create schema mytunes in db,
import tables maybe with MySQL Workbench,

run as spring-boot app;

@TODO


write import routine for traversing input folder;

lock to only m4a and mp3 file extension,
fix some bugs,
check if lazy loading of song isn't redundant
cell listener for play, set column size in grid

ENJOY!

based on the work of Mr. Marten Prieß, Mr. Bryson Dunn, and many more @ vaadin --> }>
